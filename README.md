#1 Welcome Back to Understanding Google Cloud

Welcome back. In this segment, we're going to deepen our understanding of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and explore how it came into existence. We begin with an introduction to GCP, followed by a tutorial on navigating the console. For those interested in a more foundational understanding, our "Introduction to Google Cloud" course is recommended.

## Understanding Google Cloud

Google Cloud was officially launched on April 7, 2008, by Google. The intention behind creating GCP was to provide a platform that allows end users to run applications without concern for scalability. Google's goal is to offer infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and function as a service (FaaS) to users of the platform. This integration allows users to manage infrastructure, software, and a platform for building, launching, and monitoring all in one place.

GCP is designed with services that focus on building and maintaining applications, providing end users with a secure, managed environment to explore solutions based on their business needs at a fraction of the cost of managing a network or environment themselves.

## Getting Hands-On with Google Cloud

Are you ready to get hands-on? We will start by setting up the Google Cloud Playground and then explore the GCP Console.

### Setting Up the Google Cloud Playground

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Click on "Start Google Cloud Sandbox" in the ACG Cloud Playground.
2. You will be given a username, a password, and a URL.
3. Copy the URL and open it in an incognito window.
4. Paste the link, enter the username and password provided, and accept the terms of service.

You should now be logged into your Cloud Playground Student account at ACG. This sandbox allows you four hours to explore Google Cloud thoroughly.

### Exploring the GCP Console

After accepting the terms of service, you can start at the home navigation where you'll find tools for various GCP services, including networking, operations, databases, and many others. This is an opportunity to familiarize yourself with how Google Cloud works.

One tool we'll discuss more is the **Google Cloud Shell**. By activating the Cloud Shell, you'll have access to a Linux server with up to 5 gigabytes of storage. This server can connect you with any services you need within Google Cloud.

## Key Takeaways

- GCP provides IaaS, SaaS, and FaaS environments for your business needs.
- GCP is built and designed for services focused on building and maintaining applications.
- To dive deeper into the fundamentals of Google Cloud, check out the "Introduction to Google Cloud" course.

Thank you for joining me in learning and discovering more about how Google Cloud works and came to be. Now, go ahead and mark this lesson complete, and I'll see you all in the next session.
