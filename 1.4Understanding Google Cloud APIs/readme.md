# Google Cloud APIs Overview

Welcome back, Gurus. In this lesson, we dive into the world of Google Cloud APIs to understand how they work and how they can be managed. Ready to become more proficient with Google Cloud APIs? Let's get started.

## What are Google Cloud APIs?

Google Cloud APIs are the interfaces through which you interact with Google Cloud services programmatically. Like ports on a computer that allow for various interactions, APIs enable you to automate your workflow using different programming languages through the Cloud SDK, granting you access to services ranging from compute to storage.

## Managing Cloud APIs

Managing APIs is a breeze with the API Management Console. Here you can:

- Monitor API requests, traffic, error rates, and latency.
- Access the API library full of services.
- Create API credentials, such as API keys, which help GCP identify API users.

## Hands-On with Google Cloud APIs

Let's jump into the Google Cloud Console:

1. Navigate to APIs & Services > Dashboard.
2. Review request statistics, errors, and latency for your enabled APIs.
3. Use the 'Enable API and Services' button to find and manage APIs.
4. Enable an API by selecting it and clicking 'Enable' or manage it if it's already enabled.

Alternatively, you can use the Google Cloud Shell to enable APIs:

```sh
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com
