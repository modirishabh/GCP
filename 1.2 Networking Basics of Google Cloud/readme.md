# Networking Basics of Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Welcome back, Gurus. This document serves as a primer on the foundational networking concepts within GCP, which are essential for securing and managing cloud resources.

## Understanding GCP's Networking Infrastructure

GCP's networking is structured in three layers:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: The virtual network that hosts your cloud resources, similar to a physical network setup.
- **Subnets**: Divisions within a VPC where resources are assigned private IP addresses and grouped together.
- **Routers**: Facilitate the flow of data, ensuring it reaches the intended destinations within your VPC's subnets.

## The Importance of IAM and Firewall Rules

To maintain a secure and controlled environment, GCP employs:

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Allows fine-grained access control to resources, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
- **Firewall Rules**: Specify the conditions under which traffic is allowed or denied, adding a layer of security to your network.

## Networking Traffic Flow

When traffic enters the network from the external internet, it is directed by the VPC router to the relevant subnets across different regions, based on the configured routes and rules.

## Key Takeaways for the GCP Cloud Associate Exam

- The VPC forms the backbone of networking within GCP.
- Subnets and routers play crucial roles in managing the internal flow of traffic.
- IAM and firewall rules are instrumental in defining access permissions and security measures.

Thank you for engaging with this overview of Google Cloud's networking basics. As you continue to prepare for the ACE exam, keep in mind these foundational concepts. I'll see you in the next videos for more in-depth learning. Great job, Gurus!
