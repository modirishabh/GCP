## Google Cloud Fiber Network

Google Cloud boasts a global fiber network, which at the time of this recording, has expanded to 28 regions, 85 zones, and 146 edge locations worldwide. This network's design revolves around three core pillars:

### Trust and Security

- GCP is built with a secure-by-design infrastructure, protecting your information, applications, and identity.

### Open Cloud

- The open cloud model emphasizes open source, allowing you to deploy and utilize services with infrastructure on and off public cloud platforms.

### Analytics and Artificial Intelligence

- Google Cloud facilitates a faster and smoother connection to serve customers with better solutions, powered by analytics and AI.

## Data Centers

The power behind Google Cloud's network lies in its physical data centers located across the 85 zones within the 28 regions. These data centers, equipped with physical networking and servers, enable global scaling. They are interconnected within the same zones to ensure low-latency connections and disaster recovery. These facilities are continuously updated to ensure high availability.

## Key Takeaways

- Google Cloud is a widespread global fiber network with a vast reach.
- The foundation of Google Cloud includes trust and security, open cloud principles, and a focus on analytics and AI.
- Data centers are integral to the network, constantly being improved and maintained for high availability.
