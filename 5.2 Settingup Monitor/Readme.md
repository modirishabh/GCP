# Setting Up Cloud Monitoring in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Welcome back, Gurus. This guide covers the essential steps to set up Cloud Monitoring for a Compute Engine instance in GCP.

## Objectives for Cloud Monitoring Setup

Our aim is to monitor a VM instance effectively using GCP's monitoring tools. We'll accomplish this by:

- Creating a Compute Engine instance.
- Installing the Cloud Ops Agent for monitoring and logging.
- Configuring a Cloud Monitoring workspace to visualize and manage metrics.

## Steps to Implement Cloud Monitoring

Follow these steps to set up your monitoring environment:

1. **Compute Engine Instance**: Launch an instance in your preferred region and zone.
2. **Install Cloud Ops Agent**: SSH into your instance and run the provided `curl` and `bash` commands to install the agent.
3. **Verify Agent Status**: Ensure the Cloud Ops Agent is active and functioning correctly.
4. **Monitoring Workspace**: Go to the Monitoring section in GCP and verify that the instance appears on the dashboard.
5. **Explore Dashboard**: Check metrics and set up alerting policies to monitor your instance's health and performance.

## Key Exam Takeaways

- The Cloud Ops Agent is crucial for combining monitoring and logging capabilities on a VM.
- A Monitoring workspace is your central hub for observing cloud resource performance.
- Custom metrics and alert policies can be configured to maintain optimal operation of services.
