# Google App Engine (GAE) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Welcome back, Gurus. This lesson introduces Google App Engine (GAE), a powerful serverless platform that simplifies application deployment on Google Cloud.

## Introduction to Google App Engine

Google App Engine provides a serverless environment that allows developers to focus on coding without worrying about infrastructure management.

## How Does App Engine Work?

App Engine abstracts away infrastructure complexities and provides:

- **Container-Based Scalability**: Automatically scales applications using containers, maintaining availability and performance.
- **Integrated GCP Services**: Seamlessly integrates with other GCP services to handle traffic, storage, and databases.
- **Developer-Friendly Platform**: Offers an environment optimized for developer productivity and ease of use.

## App Engine Versions and A/B Testing

App Engine facilitates A/B testing by enabling:

- **Version Control**: Deploy different versions of your application to test features or improvements.
- **Traffic Splitting**: Gradually route a portion of traffic to new versions, controlling the rollout of updates.

## Key Takeaways for the GCP Cloud Associate Exam

- Understand the serverless nature of App Engine and its benefits for application deployment.
- Familiarize yourself with the programming languages supported by App Engine and the concept of custom runtimes.
- Grasp the importance of managing application versions for effective A/B testing.
