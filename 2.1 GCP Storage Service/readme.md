# Storage Service Options in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Welcome back, Gurus. This lesson is dedicated to understanding the various storage service options available in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By the end of this lesson, you will have a clear idea of the types of storage provided by GCP and the specific services that fit each category.

## Types of Storage Options in GCP

GCP offers three distinct storage services, each designed to meet different storage requirements:

### Object Storage

- **Cloud Storage**: Ideal for storing objects like photos, videos, or files of any format. It provides flexible storage classes and allows you to encrypt your data at rest. You pay for the amount of data stored and the duration of storage.

### File Storage

- **Cloud Filestore**: A service that offers a file system interface and a shared file system for data. It's designed for applications that require managing data across multiple virtual machines and offers regional availability with automatic encryption at rest.

### Block Storage

- **Persistent Disk**: Serves as a durable network storage device. It allows you to attach and detach disks to instances, offering flexibility in sharing disk properties. Persistent Disks come in SSD and HDD types, catering to high performance or low-cost bulk throughput needs, respectively.

## Persistent Disk Varieties

Understanding the different types of Persistent Disk is important:

- **Zonal Persistent Disk**: The default block storage for instances, located within a single zone.
- **Regional Persistent Disk**: Block storage replicated between two zones, providing higher availability.
- **Local SSD**: Offers high I/O performance and low latency, suitable for applications requiring fast data access.

## Key Takeaways for the Exam

- There are three primary types of storage services: object storage (Cloud Storage), file storage (Cloud Filestore), and block storage (Persistent Disk).
- Know when and how to use each storage service, as well as their differences.
- Familiarize yourself with the three types of Persistent Disk and their use cases.

Thank you for joining this lesson on storage service options in GCP. As we continue to prepare for the Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE) exam, we'll delve deeper into the capabilities of Google Cloud. See you in the next video!
