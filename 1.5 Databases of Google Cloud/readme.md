# Google Cloud Database Overview

Welcome back, everyone. In this lesson, we explore the various database options available in Google Cloud. We'll look at what types of databases are offered and their responsibilities. Let's dive in.

## Types of Google Cloud Databases

Google Cloud categorizes its databases into two types: relational and non-relational (NoSQL).

### Relational Databases

- **Cloud SQL**: Provides MySQL, Postgres, and SQL Server engines with automated backups, replication, encryption, and capacity scaling. It guarantees over 99.95% availability.
- **Cloud Spanner**: A globally distributed, enterprise-grade database with strong consistency and a dedicated network for low latency and high reliability.

### Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

- **Cloud Bigtable**: A NoSQL wide column store designed for large-scale, low-latency workloads, ideal for machine learning applications.
- **Cloud Firestore**: A NoSQL database for developing mobile, web, and IoT applications with easy data syncing and querying.
- **Firebase**: Offers real-time data storage and syncing, along with other services like Cloud Messaging and Cloud Functions for developing powerful applications.
- **Memorystore**: A fully managed Redis and Memcached service for high-performance, scalable web applications requiring millisecond data access.
