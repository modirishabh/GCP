# Loading Data into BigQuery from Cloud Storage in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Welcome back, Gurus. This guide walks you through the process of uploading data to Cloud Storage and then loading it into BigQuery for analysis.

## Demo Objectives for Loading Data

Our goal is to utilize GCP's storage and data analysis services to:

- Create a storage bucket for our data files.
- Upload a CSV file with data to be analyzed.
- Import that data into BigQuery for querying and analysis.

## Steps to Load Data from Cloud Storage to BigQuery

Follow these instructions to analyze your data with BigQuery:

1. **Cloud Storage Bucket**: Create a new bucket with an appropriate name and configure the settings as per your requirements.
2. **Upload CSV File**: Add your data file to the bucket.
3. **BigQuery Dataset**: Within BigQuery, create a dataset in the same region as your bucket.
4. **BigQuery Table**: Create a new table by selecting the CSV file from Cloud Storage, and configure the schema settings.
5. **Analyze Data**: Execute queries against your newly created BigQuery table to analyze your data.

## Key Exam Takeaways

- Familiarize yourself with the steps to load data into BigQuery from Cloud Storage.
- Know which data formats BigQuery supports for data loading and the different Cloud Storage classes compatible with BigQuery.
- Understand how to execute queries in BigQuery to derive insights from your data.
