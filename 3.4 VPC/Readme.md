# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Networking in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Welcome back, Gurus. This lesson is focused on the foundational aspects of VPC networking within GCP, an essential concept for hosting and scaling cloud resources securely.

## Understanding VPC in GCP

Google Cloudâ€™s VPC offers a robust networking solution for your cloud resources, ensuring they are hosted within a secure and scalable environment.

## Key Features and Components of VPC

VPCs in GCP come packed with features and components that enable efficient network management:

- **Scalability**: Grow your network as needed without any downtime.
- **Bring Your Own IPs**: Use your existing IP addresses within GCP's network.
- **Flow Logs**: Monitor network traffic for security and auditing purposes.

### Core VPC Services

- **Routes**: Control the flow of traffic within your VPC.
- **Firewall Rules**: Define access controls for your resources.
- **Cloud VPN**: Establish secure connections with other networks.
- **VPC Peering**: Seamlessly connect separate VPCs.
- **Cloud Load Balancing**: Evenly distribute incoming network traffic.
- **Subnets**: Organize your resources within dedicated sub-networks.

## Hands-On Demo: Creating a Custom VPC

During the hands-on portion of the lesson, we navigated through creating a VPC from scratch, which included:

1. Initiating a custom VPC creation process in the GCP Console.
2. Defining a custom subnet with specific IP ranges.
3. Enabling flow logs for the subnet to monitor network activity.

## Key Takeaways

- VPCs are integral to managing cloud resources in a secure and organized manner.
- Understanding the various components and services that make up a VPC is crucial for network architecture and design.
- Practical experience with creating and configuring VPCs and subnets is valuable for the GCP Cloud Associate exam.

Thank you for participating in this lesson on VPC networking. As we continue our journey, we'll delve deeper into compute services and networking strategies. See you in the next video!
