# Google Cloud Database Services Summary

This document summarizes key concepts of Google Cloud’s managed database services for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

---

## Cloud SQL
- Fully managed relational database service supporting **MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server**.
- Google handles **patching, updates, and backups**; you manage DB users.
- **High availability (HA):** Primary and standby instances with synchronous replication for automatic failover.
- Supports **read replicas**, point-in-time recovery, and **on-demand backups**.
- Connection options:
  - **Private IP:** Best for security and performance within the same VPC/region.
  - **Cloud SQL Auth Proxy:** For secure external connection.
  - **Authorized external IP:** Least secure, for specific cases.
- Use **Cloud SQL** when you need a managed relational database but **don’t require horizontal scaling** or global replication.
- Cloud SQL is configured to automatically increase its storage capacity when it detects that available space is running low. This is a core feature of the managed service.While automatic increases are helpful, you might not want your database to grow indefinitely and generate a huge bill. To control this, Cloud SQL provides an option called the **automatic storage increase limit**. This allows you to set an upper boundary so the database will automatically grow, but only up to the limit you define.

## Cloud Spanner
- **Globally distributed, horizontally scalable relational database**.
- Combines relational schema and SQL with **NoSQL-like scale and high availability**.
- Offers **petabyte capacity**, **strong consistency**, and **automatic synchronous replication**.
- Ideal for **financial, inventory, and mission-critical apps** needing **global consistency**.
- SLAs vary by regional vs multi-regional configuration.
- Use **Cloud Spanner** when you outgrow traditional RDBMS or need **global transactions**.

---

## AlloyDB for PostgreSQL
- **Fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible** database for **transactional + analytical** workloads.
- Uses Google’s custom engine for **4× faster transactional** and **up to 100× faster analytical** performance compared to standard PostgreSQL.
- Automates **backups, replication, patching,** and **capacity management**.
- Integrates with **Vertex AI** for real-time ML predictions.
- Best for **enterprise-grade PostgreSQL workloads** needing **99.99% uptime** and advanced analytics.

---

## Cloud Bigtable
- **Fully managed NoSQL database** for **large, low-latency**, read/write workloads (petabyte scale).
- Powers Google services like Search and Maps.
- Ideal for **IoT, time-series, analytics, and ML applications**.
- Uses **HBase-compatible API** for easy integration.
- Data model:
  - Tables organized by **row keys**, **column families**, and **qualifiers**.
  - Supports versioned cells with timestamps.
- Scales linearly — adding nodes increases throughput proportionally.
- Use **Cloud Bigtable** for **high throughput, low latency**, and **structured or semi-structured** data.

---

## Memorystore (for Redis)
- **Managed in-memory data store** built on Redis.
- Provides **sub-millisecond latency**, **high availability**, and **99.9% SLA**.
- Handles **failover, patching, scaling**, and **monitoring** automatically.
- Scales up to **300 GB** and **12 Gbps throughput** per instance.
- **Protocol compatible with Redis**, so existing applications work without modification.
- Use **Memorystore** for **caching, gaming, session management, or real-time analytics**.

# Cloud Firestore Overview

Cloud Firestore is a fully managed, **serverless NoSQL document database** on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
It’s designed for mobile, web, and server applications that require **real-time synchronization** and **offline support**.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Flexible Data Model:** Store data in documents organized into collections.
- **Nested Objects and Subcollections:** Support for complex hierarchical data structures.
- **Advanced Querying:** Execute structured queries, including vector search and ACID transactions.
- **High Availability:** Automatic multi-region replication with up to **99.999% SLA** uptime.
- **Real-time Updates:** Subscribe to live data changes across multiple clients.
- **Offline Persistence:** Cache data locally and sync changes when back online.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works with Firebase Authentication, Cloud Functions, and other GCP services.

---

## 💡 Common Use Cases

- **Mobile/Web Applications:** Chat apps, leaderboards, or shared content updates.
- **Gaming:** Store user profiles, achievements, and in-game assets.
- **Content Management:** Manage media libraries, user-generated content, and metadata.
- **Analytics & Monitoring:** Real-time dashboards or event-driven notifications.

---

## 🧰 SDK & Language Support

Firestore provides SDKs for the following platforms:

- **Client SDKs:** Android, iOS, JavaScript (Web)
- **Server SDKs:** Node.js, Python, Go, Java, C#

Each SDK supports offline mode, transactional writes, and real-time listeners.
