# Google Cloud Shell and Cloud Shell Editor

Welcome back, Gurus. In this session, we're focusing on the Google Cloud Shell, an essential service in GCP that provides a container for operations and development accessible from any location.

## What is Google Cloud Shell?

Google Cloud Shell is a Linux-based container that grants you command-line access to your Google Cloud environment. It's equipped with 5 gigabytes of persistent storage, and because it's powered by Linux, it provides you with the flexibility to interact with services across the GCP platform.

## Pre-installed Tools in Cloud Shell

- The Cloud Shell comes pre-loaded with a suite of tools to help you manage your Google Cloud services, including:
  - `gcloud`: The Google Cloud command-line tool.
  - `MySQL`: The popular database management system.
  - `Docker`: A tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications.
  - `Kubernetes`: An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Cloud Shell Editor

The Cloud Shell Editor is an integrated development environment (IDE) built into Google Cloud. It's powered by the Eclipse Theia platform and supports various programming languages. This IDE allows you to efficiently browse, view, and edit files within your Cloud Shell, and it supports integration with source control for multiple projects.

## Hands-On with Cloud Shell

Here's how you can get started with Cloud Shell:
1. Access the Cloud Shell from the GCP console.
2. Use basic commands to navigate and manage files within the home directory.
3. Explore the Cloud Shell Editor to edit and save files, providing an interactive development experience.

## Key Takeaways

- Cloud Shell is a versatile Linux container with 5 GB of persistent storage, accessible from anywhere.
- It includes essential tools for managing GCP services and supports various programming languages.
- The Cloud Shell Editor is a powerful IDE that enhances file management and development within the Google Cloud environment.

Thank you for joining this lesson on the Cloud Shell. As we proceed in this course, we'll gain more insights into Google Cloud and prepare for the Associate Cloud Engineer exam. See you in the next video, Gurus!
